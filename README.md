### Data structures / Algorithms

### Motivation

This repository is solely for my own personal growth of learning data structures and algorithms.  I strongly believe that continued practice of algorithms and absorbtion of knowledge regarding computer science will help me become a better developer overall. I never got the chance to get a computer science degree when I was younger so I am self-studying myself in order to continue and improve my problem solving capabilities and general fundamentals.

My general approach to a problem is to spend a few minutes writing psuedo-code before trying my hand at the implementation in code.  After I have completed the initial implementation on my computer, I review by trying the process again in front of a whiteboard where I try speak out loud to myself about edge cases and optimizations.

### A list of topics I study
- Big O (time / space complexity)
- Data structures
- Searching / Sorting Algorithms
- General Algorithm Questions
- Recursion
