### Data structures / Algorithms

### Motivation

This repository is solely for my own personal growth of learning data structures and algorithms. I strongly believe that continued practice of algorithms and absorbtion of knowledge regarding computer science will help me become a better developer overall. I never got the chance to get a computer science degree when I was younger so I am self-studying myself in order to continue and improve my problem solving capabilities and general fundamentals.

My general approach to a problem is to spend a few minutes talking to myself with a pen and paper to jot down edge cases and expected return outputs before trying to implement the code in an IDE. After I have completed the initial implementation by hand and step through of my hand-written code, I code it up on my computer. If I have extra time, I will review on a whiteboard.

Please follow the instructions below if you would like to spin up the test suite for yourself.

### A list of topics I study

- Big O (time / space complexity)
